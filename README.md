# Why LeetCode and I Are Not Friends

1. LeetCode vs. My Tea: Every time I open LeetCode, my tea mysteriously gets cold. It's as if LeetCode sends a chill down my tea mug.


2. The Time-Traveling Conundrum: I'm convinced that LeetCode is a time vortex. I start a problem, and suddenly it's tomorrow. Where does the time go? Clearly, LeetCode is bending the space-time continuum.

3. My Cat's Disapproval: My cat, seems to judge me with disdain every time I work on a LeetCode problem. I trust his judgment implicitly. If he says no to LeetCode, who am I to argue?
